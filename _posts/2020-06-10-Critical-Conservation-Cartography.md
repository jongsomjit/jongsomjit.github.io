This is a literture review paper covering the topic of critical cartography as it relates to conservation. It was written in my first seminar course in geography at SFSU which was a pleasure to take and where I learned so much
about the breadth and scope of geography.  


Critical cartography addresses a maps assumptions, powers, weaknesses, and inherent
problems. While at a basic level, maps may be perceived by many as a
simple image depicting some part of our world (and assumed as such to be trustworthy, or at least
objective in its representation of the world), this disarming simplicity belies a deep power to shape
ideas; as a commonality, maps give a voice to whomever is creating them and this voice can be seen as
the capacity to dictate the terms of how space is used or perceived. In this paper, I will first
provide a brief overview of critical cartography concepts and findings since its socio-political foundations
in the 1980â€™s. I will then review how concepts from critical cartography have been used to highlight
shortcomings and problems in conservation maps.
