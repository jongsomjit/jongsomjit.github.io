I'm a GIS Specialist at Point Blue Conservation Science 
and a masters student at San Francisco State University 
who focuses on using species location data and remotely-sensed 
environmental covariates to explore the impacts of our changing world on wildlife.

Through this site I hope to share my experiences, both professional and personal because my life is not just one or the other.  They are intertwined. One influences the other. I want to explore the journey of how I went from an urban "at-risk" kid growing up in the gritty streets of Los Angeles to an ecologist and scientist 
working with a team to help discover how nature and wildlife tick and what we can do to provide them with a voice. I also want to share stories about the work I am a part of to help build connections, ideas, and perhaps a bit of inspiration for myself and others.
